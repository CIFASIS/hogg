HOgg 0.2.0 Released
-------------------

The HOgg package provides a commandline tool for manipulating Ogg files,
and a corresponding Haskell library.

  http://snapper.kfish.org/~conrad/software/hogg/

This is the initial public release. The focus is on correctness of Ogg
parsing and production. The capabilities of the hogg commandline tool are
roughly on par with those of the oggz* tools[0], although hogg does not
yet provide an equivalent to oggz-validate.

HOgg supports chained and multiplexed Ogg bitstreams conformant with
RFC3533[1]. HOgg can parse headers for CMML, FLAC, OggPCM, Speex, Theora
and Vorbis media codecs, and can read and write Ogg Skeleton bitstreams.

Installation
------------

I am very interested in hearing about problems with building or installing
the package, particularly from people who are not yet familiar with building
from Haskell source. You need ghc instead of gcc; it compiles to a binary:

    $ ./Setup.hs configure
    $ ./Setup.hs build
    $ sudo ./Setup.hs install

Building of this release has been tested with:
  * GHC versions 6.4 and 6.6 [2]
  * The Haskell build system "Cabal" versions 1.1.3, 1.1.4, 1.1.6, and the
    current development trunk. [3]
  * fps (Data.ByteString.Lazy) version 0.7, and development trunk. [4]

Note that if you are using the recently-released GHC 6.6 then you will not
need separate installs of Cabal or fps. You will however need to remove the
word "fps" from the hogg.cabal file; see the README for details.

The GHC and Cabal versions listed above span the packages available in most
current distributions. I've tested on Debian unstable, Ubuntu Dapper and
Ubuntu Edgy. I'm particularly interested to hear reports of build success or
failure on other distributions or operating systems.
