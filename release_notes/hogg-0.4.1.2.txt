HOgg 0.4.1.2 Released
---------------------

The HOgg package provides a commandline tool for manipulating Ogg files,
and a corresponding Haskell library. HOgg is in hackage, or on the web at:

  http://www.kfish.org/~conrad/software/hogg/

This is the fourth public release. The focus is on correctness of Ogg
parsing, production and editing. The capabilities of the hogg commandline
tool are roughly on par with those of the oggz* [0] tools.

HOgg supports chained and multiplexed Ogg bitstreams conformant with
RFC3533[1]. HOgg can parse headers for CELT, CMML, FLAC, OggPCM, Speex, Theora
and Vorbis media codecs, and can read and write Ogg Skeleton bitstreams.

New in this release
-------------------

This release introduces no functionality changes. 

Hackage Installation
--------------------

HOgg is in Hackage, at:
http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hogg-0.4.1.2

If you have the Hackage "cabal" system installed, simply run:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install hogg

Source Tarball Installation
---------------------------

I am very interested in hearing about problems with building or installing
the package, particularly from people who are not yet familiar with building
from Haskell source. You need ghc instead of gcc; it compiles to a binary:

    $ cabal configure
    $ cabal build
    $ cabal install

(A ./Setup.hs is also included, which may be used in place of the "cabal"
command if that not present).

Building of this release has been tested with:
  * GHC versions 7.0.3, 7.2.1, 7.4.2, 7.6.0 [2]
  * The Haskell build system "Cabal" version 1.14.0 [3]

The GHC and Cabal versions listed above span the packages available in most
current distributions. I've tested on Ubuntu 10.10. I'm particularly interested
to hear reports of build success or failure on other distributions or operating
systems.

Usage
-----

$ hogg help
Usage: hogg <subcommand> [options] filename ...

  hogg is a commandline tool for manipulating Ogg files. It supports chained 
  and multiplexed files conformant with RFC3533. Hogg can parse headers for 
  CELT, CMML, FLAC, PCM, Speex, Theora and Vorbis, and can read and write Ogg 
  Skeleton logical bitstreams.

Commands:
  help          Display help for a specific subcommand (eg. "hogg help chop")
  man           Generate Unix man page for a specific subcommand (eg. "hogg man chop")

Reporting:
  info          Display information about the specified files and their bitstreams
  dump          Hexdump packets of an Ogg file
  pagedump      Display page structure of an Ogg file
  dumpraw       Dump raw (unparsed) page data

Extraction:
  rip           Rip selected logical bistreams from an Ogg file (default: all)
  reconstruct   Reconstruct an Ogg file by doing a full packet demux

Editing:
  chop          Extract a section (specify start and/or end time)
  merge         Merge, interleaving pages in order of presentation time
  sort          Rewrite with correct page ordering
  addskel       Write a Skeleton logical bitstream

Miscellaneous:
  known-codecs  List codecs known by this version of hogg

Please report bugs to <ogg-dev@xiph.org>


New subcommand man
------------------

$ hogg help man
man: Generate Unix man page for a specific subcommand (eg. "hogg man chop")
Usage: hogg man [options]

Examples:
  Generate a man page for the "hogg chop" subcommand:
    hogg man chop

Options:
  -h, -?  --help     Display this help and exit
  -V      --version  Output version information and exit
